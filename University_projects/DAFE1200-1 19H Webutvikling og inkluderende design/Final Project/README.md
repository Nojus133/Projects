# Final Project

Project:

## Assignment description
The aim of this assignment is for you to take an idea and put it into practice by showing the 
knowledge, skills and abilities you have learned in this course. In this project you should be 
able to highlight what you know (the topics covered in class) and what you can do (code a 
website). Some questions to consider in this assignment:  
* What are the privacy implications for the design choices I made?   
* How will each of our design choices affect UX, usability, universal design, and 
accessibility?   
* How accessible is the design for people with disabilities? 
* Is the website usable for everyone? 
* Have we taken into consideration the people that will use our site, the activities they 
will engage in, the context in which they will use our site and the technologies they 
will use to access our site?  
* Is my website responsive? 
* With whom and how can I test the usability of our website?
