## Assignment description
The aim of this assignment is for you to take an idea and put it into practice by showing the 
knowledge, skills and abilities you have learned in this course. In this project you should be 
able to highlight what you know (the topics covered in class) and what you can do (code a 
website). Some questions to consider in this assignment:  
* What are the privacy implications for the design choices I made?   
* How will each of our design choices affect UX, usability, universal design, and 
accessibility?   
* How accessible is the design for people with disabilities? 
* Is the website usable for everyone? 
* Have we taken into consideration the people that will use our site, the activities they 
will engage in, the context in which they will use our site and the technologies they 
will use to access our site?  
* Is my website responsive? 
* With whom and how can I test the usability of our website? 

## Guidelines
This assignment consists of three parts

### Part 1: 
* Choose one of the topics from the lectures or identify a relevant social or 
technological challenge that interests you. 
* Create a potential solution to the problem. Your solution should not already exist, 
but you may use an existing solution in a new or different way. Your solution does 
not have to feasible, but it should be possible to achieve in three to five years. 

### Part 2:
* Create a website that
  - Explains why the problem is important from a social or technological perspective. 
  - Describes how the problem relates to the solution that you have identified.  
  - Describes what the solution is. For example, if your solution is a mobile app, 
then describe the app. You do not need to code the solution, but prototyping 
it is recommended.   
* The website can include text, images, videos, hyperlinks or any other forms of web 
content that your group created or that you cite appropriately. 
* Accessibility and usability are more important than functionality. In other words, do 
not design the page to look “cool” design it to be effective, efficient and satisfying 
for the user.  

### Part 3: 
* Individually rate your group members 
* Rate each group member’s contribution to the project using the peer evaluation
